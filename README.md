# Chatbot

Abstract: In this assignment, we created a simple chat bot webpage. With apigClient SDK, the front-end is hosted on an AWS S3 bucket in JavaScript and HTML (the link is given below). It pushes requests and receives responses with the back-end in JSON. As for the back-end, we imported original Swagger API into AWS API Gateway, set up CORS, generated APIs with API Keys and API SDK for front-end use. We also constructed Lambda functions in the back-end to deal with front-end HTTP POST requests. A response would be given to the front-end in which it is extracted to show a message on the website. The whole project is uploaded to Github.
